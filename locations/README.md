To understand the Kalix concepts that are the basis for this example, see [Designing services](https://docs.kalix.io/services/development-process.html) in the documentation.


This project contains the framework to create a Kalix application by adding Kalix components. To understand more about these components, see [Developing services](https://docs.kalix.io/services/) and check Spring-SDK [official documentation](https://docs.kalix.io/spring/index.html). Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/lightbend/kalix-jvm-sdk/tree/main/samples) in the folders with "spring" in their name.


Use Maven to build your project:

```shell
mvn compile
```


To run the example locally, you must run the Kalix proxy. The included `docker-compose` file contains the configuration required to run the proxy for a locally running application.
It also contains the configuration to start a local Google Pub/Sub emulator that the Kalix proxy will connect to.
To start the proxy, run the following command from this directory:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

To start the application locally, the `spring-boot-maven-plugin` is used. Use the following command:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

With both the proxy and your application running, once you have defined endpoints they should be available at `http://localhost:9000`.


To deploy your service, install the `kalix` CLI as documented in
[Setting up a local development environment](https://docs.kalix.io/setting-up/)
and configure a Docker Registry to upload your docker image to.

You will need to update the `dockerImage` property in the `pom.xml` and refer to
[Configuring registries](https://docs.kalix.io/projects/container-registries.html)
for more information on how to make your docker image available to Kalix.

Finally, you can use the [Kalix Console](https://console.kalix.io)
to create a project and then deploy your service into the project either by using `mvn deploy kalix:deploy` which
will conveniently package, publish your docker image, and deploy your service to Kalix, or by first packaging and
publishing the docker image through `mvn deploy` and then deploying the image
through the `kalix` CLI.
